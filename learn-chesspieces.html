                    <h2>Pawn </h2>
                    <p>The pawn is a basic piece in chess and each player starts with eight pawns. Each pawns worth 1
                        point.
                        The
                        starting position of the pawns are on the second rank which is in front of the minor and major
                        pieces.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>The pawn is the weakest piece on the game, but in the opening part it is very important. It is
                        used
                        to
                        control
                        the central squares. Later on the pawn will serve as a supporting piece. It is very important in
                        a
                        game
                        because a player can win with only one pawn advantage</p>
                    <h3>Movement</h3>
                    <ol class="movement">
                        <li>The pawn may move forward to unoccupied square and up to two square on its first move</li>
                        <li>It may capture diagonally in front of adjacent file if it is occupied by opponent's piece
                        </li>
                        <li>En passant' capture is applicable only if a pawn attacking square is passed by the opponents
                            pawn
                            which
                            has advanced two squares</li>
                        <li>When the pawn reaches the last rank, it must be promoted to a new piece. It may be a new
                            rook,
                            knight,
                            bishop or a queen</li>
                        <li id="rook">Pawn is the only piece that can't move backwards.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Rook</h2>
                    <p>The rook is major piece in the game each players starts with two rooks each. Rook is only
                        outranked
                        by
                        the
                        queen
                        and it is worth 5 points. The starting position of the rook is in the four corners of the board
                    </p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>The rook is a strong piece it commonly used to control open and semi-open files. This piece is
                        favorable
                        on
                        the
                        end game and weak on early stage of the game. End games are more likely to be an open position
                        so it
                        control a
                        lot of squares.</p>
                    <h3>Movement</h3>
                    <ol class="movement">
                        <li>The rook can move any number of squares horizontally and vertically.</li>
                        <li id="knight">Can't jump over a piece</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Knight</h2>
                    <p>The knight is a minor piece piece in the game and each player has two knights. The starting
                        position
                        of
                        the
                        knight is on b1/g1 for white and b8/g8 for black. The knight is worth 3 points and it is
                        considered
                        as
                        strong
                        as bishop</p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>The knight is a complex piece in the game and its movement is unique. Knights are slightly
                        better
                        from
                        bishop
                        on closed position and slightly worse during open games. Knights are better if they control
                        a
                        lot of
                        squares.
                        So it is better if placed on the middle of the board and it is not ideal on the edge of the
                        board.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Movement</h3>
                    <ol class="movement">
                        <li>The knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece.
                        </li>
                        <li id="bishop">It may move to the nearest square which stands but not on the same rank, file or
                            diagonal.
                            Some
                            thought of
                            it as an L pattern.</li>

                    <h2>Bishop</h2>
                    <p>The bishop is a minor piece in the game and each player starts with two bishops. The first
                        bishop
                        control
                        the
                        light squares and the other control the dark squares. It is located at c1/f1 for white and
                        c8/f8
                        for
                        black.
                        The bishop is worth 3 points the same as the knight</p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>Bishops control long diagonals in the board. It is a good attacking and defending piece. A
                        pair
                        of
                        bishop
                        works together if they are not blocked. They can cover the entire board if placed in an
                        active
                        square.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Movement</h3>
                    <ol class="movement">
                        <li>Bishops moves diagonally and never leave the color of it's square.</li>

                    <h2>Queen</h2>
                    <p>Queens are the most powerful piece on the board. Each player starts with one queen and it is
                        located
                        on
                        d1
                        square for white and d3 square for black. Queen is a major piece like the rook and it is
                        worth 9
                        points.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>Since queen is a powerful piece avoid to move it early in the game so it can't be attack by
                        weaker
                        pieces.
                        Try to bring your queen to a safe square and controls many squares. </p>

                    <ol class="movement">
                        <li>Queen moves the same as bishops and rooks. </p>

                    <h2>King</h2>
                    <p>King may not be as powerful as the queen but it is the most important piece on the board.
                        When
                        you
                        lose
                        your
                        king you also lost the game. Each player can only have one king in the game. This piece is
                        located
                        on e1
                        for
                        white and e8 for black.</p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>Bring your king to safety in the beggining of the game. The best strategy is to castle before
                        attacking
                        your
                        opponent. In the later part of the game king can be a powerful piece and it can oppose the
                        king
                        of
                        the
                        other
                        player. </p>
                    <h3>Movement</h3>
                    <ol class="movement">
                        <li>The king can one square in every direction.</li>
                        <li>The king should move if it is in check</li>
                        <li>It can't move to square that is being attacked by enemy piece.</li>
                        <li>Castling is a single move executed by two pieces. It transfers two squares towards the
                            rook
                            and
                            the
                            rook
                            transfers beside the king.</li>
                        <li>You can only castly if there are no pieces between the two pieces. And the king is not
                            under
                            check
                            or the
                            square that the king must pass over is controlled by an opponent's piece.</li>
